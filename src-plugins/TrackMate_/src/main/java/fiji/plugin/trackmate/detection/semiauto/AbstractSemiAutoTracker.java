/**
 * A class made to perform semi-automated tracking of spots in TrackMate &
 * friends
 * <p>
 * The user has to select one spot, one a meaningful location. The spot location
 * and its radius are then used to extract a small rectangular neighborhood in
 * the next frame around the spot. The neighborhood is then passed to a
 * {@link SpotDetector} that returns the spot it found. If a spot of
 * {@link Spot#QUALITY} high enough is found near enough to the first spot
 * center, then it is added to the model and linked with the first spot.
 * <p>
 * The process is then repeated, taking the newly found spot as a source for the
 * next neighborhood. The model is updated live for every spot found.
 * <p>
 * The process halts when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>no spots of quality high enough are found;
 * <li>spots of high quality are found, but too far from the initial spot;
 * <li>the source has no time-point left.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @author Jean-Yves Tinevez - 2013
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of the source. Must extend {@link RealType} and
 *            {@link NativeType} to use with most TrackMate {@link SpotDetector}
 *            s.
