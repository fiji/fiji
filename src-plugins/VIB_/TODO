- orthoslice
- have a tool to iterate through slices when left/right clicking (or 
  scroll-wheeling) on a slice
- have a way to open a list of objects, being able to reassign to a new 3D 
  window, or open another view of the same objects (e.g. a second slice, 
  or an isosurface)
- make it scriptable (for movie generation, presentations)
- segmentation tool (as scissors, but works only on isosurfaces, i.e. 
  thresholded objects, and does not remove, but rather label it)

segmentation editor:
	- CustomStackWindow -> SegmentationEditorPanel
	- connect to 3D viewer
	- <PageDown> like 5x <CursorRight>
	- automatically select 1st non-exterior
	- fix right click in empty areas of "Labels" list
	- HyperRoi extends Roi[]
	- morphological operators on Roi3Ds
	- turn into MDI (labels & buttons into an extra window)
	- make it a tool (to override keyboard shortcut)

VIB:
	- eye candy: file list with processes already done (checkboxes)
	- leica.Leica_SP_Reader: fix negative voxelDepth
	  (and revert all the other voodoo to work around that)
	- Gaussian Blur before optimising
	- get rid of Amira Tables
	- separate "AmiraTable_Writer" out of "AmiraMeshWriter_".
	- general code cleanup (DO_CHANGES...)
	- fix names (like AmiraMesh_Writer instead of AmiraMeshWriter_)
	- ImageMetaData.upToDate(): look at template, too
	- add rigid registration method (no labelling!)
