What does not work yet:

- Transfer modes other than SSH, e.g. FTP, SFTP, CIFS (Windows share) or
  DAV (HTTP "PUT"), are not implemented, although it is possible to add
  them in the future, if needed.

- it is not scriptable enough just yet, that is: you cannot easily
  integrate the uploading of a nightly build to a "nightly build" site.

- there are still ugly usability bugs (sometimes it seems to lag due to
  doing unnecessary processing of plugins, etc)

- there is no easy "Add Micro Manager" button in the "Manage Update Sites"
  dialog yet (which would add the site without SSH information, of
  course) :-)

Other (nice-to-haves, longer-term goals):

- Think about reusing maven's repository structure for the update sites

- If the developer tries to upload a version that has already be marked
  as a previous version, ask her loudly if she is sure.

- The actions should be editable by keyboard shortcuts.  Likewise,
  "Escape" should exit, asking if the user is sure when actions where
  selected but not launched.

- The list of plugins included in the file should be shown, too.  We can
  use fiji.User_Plugins' parsePluginsConfig() method, probably after
  wrapping it into a public method that takes a String parameter
  containing the .jar file's path.

- make the list sortable by clicking on the column titles (second click
  sorts descending).
