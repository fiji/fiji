09th January 2012:
------------------
* Buf fixes.
* Make mesh import/export macro-recordable
  (thanks to Johannes Schindelin)
* Bug fixes in the surface plot functions, thanks to Johannes Schindelin
* Make 'Export transformed' macro-recordable
* Correct drawing of 4D buttons on Mac OSX
* Make bounding-box text always aligned in x- and y-direction of the view.
* Real annotations: display text together with landmark points
* User-adjustable keyboard shortcuts.
* A completely restructured menu bar
* A context menu
* Possibility to add primitive 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, cones & tubes.
* Mesh decimation to simplify and surface meshes and make them less
  memory-consuming and thus faster renderable
* Snapshots are now macro-recordable.

06th July 2011:
---------------
* Support for exporting meshes to .u3d files, which can be embedded into PDFs, allowing for interactive 3D content in PDFs (using Adobe's Acrobat Reader)
  (find a screencast at http://3dviewer.neurofly.de/?category=Documentation&page=Screencasts).
* Allow to change light color and intensity of the 3D universe.
* Volume renderings can now be 'saturated': This mode provides a better visualization of thin fibres in images (thanks to Stephan Saalfeld)
* Support for a new Content type, MultiOrthoslices (with help from Albert Cardona)
* The color of landmark points can now be changed, thanks to Johannes Schindelin
* New controllable mesh smoothing (thanks to Albert Cardona)
* Fullscreen support.
* A 'Take snapshot' menu item which lets you choose the target image size.
* Replace AWT with Swing for the GUI.
* Syncing of several 3D Viewer windows.
* Several menu items like 'Change Color' will now work without selectiing an object,
  if only one object is present.
* Transfer functions: Arbitrary transfer functions for each individual channel
  (find a screencast at http://3dviewer.neurofly.de/?category=Documentation&page=Screencasts).
* Reader and exporter for the STL format (thanks to Michael Doube)
* Calibration ticks on bounding boxes
* Several bug fixes
