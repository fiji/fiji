Objects representing the elements of a group.
All group elements should extend {@link java.lang.Number}
and some groups elements may be standard Number types
such as {@link java.math.BigInteger}.
If the element has a natural conversion to the complex
numbers then it should implement {@link org.lsmp.djep.groupJep.values.HasComplexValueI}.
