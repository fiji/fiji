Functions and operators for working with vectors and matricies.
<p>
In the VectorJep package vectors are handled if a different fashion to standard Jep.
The VList function converts a list of values [1,2,3] into one of the MatrixValueI types:
Scaler, MVector, Matrix or Tensor.
<p>
Functions which work with Vectors in this package should handle the above types.
<p>
Furthermore if the MatrixJep package is going to be used, then classes should implement one of 
the interfaces
either UnaryOperatorI BinaryOperatorI or NaryOperatorI interfaces. These use a more efficient 
method for evaluation through the calcValue methods, 
where an object to hold the results is provided.
