/**
 *  * <p>This class finds the regional extrema of a 3 dimensional image. A regional maxima is defined as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <p>"A regional maximum M of a grayscale image I is a connected components of pixels such that every pixel in 
 * the neighborhood of M has a strictly lower value."</p>
 * 
 * <p>The definition of a regional minimum is simply the opposite; the neighboring pixels must be strictly brighter.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class does not stipulate how much brighter a regional extreme must be from the neighboring pixels, but only
 * requires that it is brighter or dimmer. So a connected component of pixels that is 1 higher in intensity from its neighbors
 * is treated the same as a connected component that is 100 higher in intensity than it's neighbors.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The {@link #getRegionalExtrema()} method returns an ArrayList of ArrayLists, where each inner ArrayLists represents
 * a regional extreme and contains the coordinates of the pixels comprising that regional extreme.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Notably, this implementation does not allow for the identification of h-domes, as mentioned by Luc Vincent
 * in his paper, "Morphological Grayscale Reconstruction in Image Analysis: Applications and Efficient Algorithms."</p>

	/**
	 * <p>Finds the regional extrema of the input image.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Algorithm:</b> Step 2.1 iterates through all of the pixels in the image with an outer cursor.
	 * For each pixel, if we have not processed the pixel previously, we then declare isExtrema to be true
	 * since the pixel could potentially be a regional extreme ('innocent until proven guilty' approach). We then
	 * add this pixel's coordinates to an ArrayList. The reason for the ArrayList is the following (example is for regional maxima): imagine
	 * a pixel which has a value of 255 (it's very bright, if 255 is white in an 8-bit image), and that
	 * 25 of his direct 3D neighbors are strictly less bright than him (<255), but that one of his neighbors
	 * is also 255. Therefore, our pixel is not a regional maximum, but this pixel and his bright neighbor
	 * COULD be. Remember, a regional max is a connected component of pixels where all neighboring pixels have strictly less intensity.
	 * The ArrayList is therefore used to hold the coordinates of the pixels comprising regional extrema.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>So, step 2.2 is the iteration through the pixels in the ArrayList. If a neighboring pixel is found 
	 * to be strictly brighter (or lower), we mark isExtreme false, but continue iterating through the connected component because we know that the connected component cannot be
	 * a regional extreme, but we can save time by marking the pixels in this connected component as visited while we are here. If a neighboring 
	 * pixel is found to have the same intensity value, that pixel is added to the ArrayList and subsequently searched. 
	 * We stop this iteration once nothing more is added to the ArrayList (we've searched the entire connected component of our initial 
	 * pixel from step 2.1).</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Step 2.3 is the actual iteration through the neighbors of our current pixel from step 2.2.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Once the connected component is completely searched, if isExtreme == true, then we never found
	 * a brighter (or dimmer) pixel, so the whole connected component is a regional extreme, and an ArrayList of the coordinates of the pixels
	 * making up the connected component is stored in another ArrayList.  If however isExtreme == false, we encountered a brighter (or dimmer) pixel on 
	 * the border of the connected component, so the connected components pixels are not regional extrema and are just ignored, but marked as
	 * processed so we don't visit again.</p>
