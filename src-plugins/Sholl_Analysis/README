Advanced Sholl Analysis PlugIn
http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:analysis:asa:start

A plugin for ImageJ, the standard in scientific image processing. Sholl analysis (Sholl,
D.A., 1953) is an old technique used by neuroanatomists to describe neuronal arbors.

Major advantages of this plugin over other implementations are:
 - It does not require previous tracing of the arbor
 - Retrieves quantitative descriptors from the Sholl profile, allowing
   statistical comparisons between arbors
 - Performs "Continuous Sholl" in 2D and 3D
