Sholl Analysis

WISH LIST
=========
    - Restrict analysis to area ROIs (rather than hemicircles/spheres?)

RELEASE NOTES
=============
Version 3.0 (latest)
    - 3D Sholl:
      - Better handling of anisotropic voxels
      - Option to ignore isolated (noise) voxels
      - Minimized rounding errors related to digitization of spheres
    - 2D Sholl:
      - Substituted "Radius span" with "Samples per radius" to avoid misinterpretations of
        the former parameter. A draconian maximum of 10 "Samples per radius" is
        deliberately imposed to encourage "Continuos Sholl"
    - General improvements:
      - 3D and 2D algorithms are ~25% faster (3D analysis remains rather slow)
      - Allows thresholded grayscale images as input
      - Analyzes polarized arbors by restricting the analysis to hemicircles/hemispheres.
        This requires the user to define the center of analysis with an orthogonal radius,
        using the Straight Line Tool and holding Shift
      - Arbor size is calculated as the area/volume of the smallest bounding circle/sphere
        containing the segmented arbor
      - When "End radius" is empty (or NaN), the largest (hemi)circle/sphere is used. This
        allows macros to easily process images without line selections
      - Precision (Scientific notation and number of decimal places) in Sholl table is set
        by "Analyze>Set Measurements..."
      - Sholl mask is coded with Matlab's "jet" color map
      - Major code clean up, which solved several issues
      - Plugin is now registered in the Analyze Menu: "Analyze>Sholl Analysis...".
        Implemented the auxiliary commands "File>Open Samples>ddaC neuron" (2D sample
        image), "Image>Lookup Tables>Sholl LUT" and "Help>About Plugins...>Sholl Plugins"
      - Prettified plot

Version 3d
    - 3D Analysis is now restricted to the volume of each Sholl shell, rather than parsing
      all the segmented voxels

Version 3c
    - 3D Sholl is usable for the first time, but remains extremely slow

Version 3a-b
    - Experimental: Performs 3D Sholl without spike suppression if input image is a stack

Version 2.5
    - Fixed duplicated points in Bresenham's algorithm
    - Option to save data on image directory, if available
    - Long analyses can be aborted by holding Esc

Version 2.4
    - Fixed a 2.3 regression in which -1 tagged pixels were being counted
    - Improved Sholl mask: Minimized rounding errors. Center of analysis is now marked
    - Improved Sholl Table and Plot display

Version 2.3
    - Results are printed to a dedicated table
    - Sholl decay is always calculated
    - Fixed exception in the calculation of critical value in non bell-shaped profiles
    - Impose valid parameters in dialog, rather than keep prompting the user (which was
      not amenable to macro recording)
    - Major code cleaning

Version 2.1-2
    - Fixed several bugs and regressions introduced in version 2.0
    - Checks for reasonable Radius span values

Version 2.0
     - Curve Fitting, modernization of Tom's code

Version 1.0
     - Initial version by Tom Maddock
