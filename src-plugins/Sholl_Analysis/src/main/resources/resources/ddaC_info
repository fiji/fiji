2D mask of a Drosophila class IV ddaC sensory neuron labeled by
ppk1.9-GAL4-driven UAS-mCD8-GFP.

This binary mask (downsized by 40%) was obtained from a maximum
intensity projection that was smoothed, thresholded and from
which the cell axon was manually removed. The original 1.1um
z-step stack was acquired using a Ultraview spinning disk confocal
system on a Nikon TE2000-U using an Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera
at the McGill University Centre for Research in Neuroscience.
