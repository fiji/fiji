SyncWindows list of changes

Version 1.1:
- Optionally passes on change of slice in StackWindow (OpenStackWindow)
  to other synchronized (Open)StackWindows. 
- Optionally translates positions to different windows via offscreen
  coordinates. -> correct registration at different zoom levels
- "Update Window List" Button, not necessary to restart the plugin
  for adding a newly opened Window.
- Not disturbed by closing windows while plugin is running.
- Can handle Polyline selections.

Version 1.2:
- When Sync_Windows is active, the ImageJ Statusbar shows the intensity value of the 
  image, which contains the "main" cursor (corrects a previous bug).
- New crosshairs Sync cursor (like it?)
- Sync_Windows is displayed in the window list.

- Sync_Measure_3D works on 16-bit images.
- Threshold values can be typed into text fields in addition to setting them with the sliders.
- z-Positions measured by Sync_Measure_3D are now consistent with the cursor
  position displayed in the ImageJ window.
- Sync_Measure_3D now measures on "Space-click". (Alt-Click and Shift-click no longer work
  as they are used to add parts to and remove parts from ROIs)
- The size adapts better to smaller screens.

Version 1.3:
- Sync_Measure_3D now measures on Double-click. (Space-click in v1.2 was a bad idea, because if a button in 
the control window still has the focus, it gets "pressed" by pressing the spacebar. Also, pressing the 
spacebar while scrolling through 16-bit image stacks resets the Min- and Max-values. 

Version 1.4:
- Works with Image5Ds (version 0.9 at least)

Version 1.4.1:
- Works with Image5Ds AND WITHOUT Image5Ds. Version 1.4 only worked, when the Image5D plugins were installed.

Version 1.5:
- Uses the new ImageListener interface to update the image list. This also works with Image5Ds when version 
  1.1.5 or higher of Image5D is installed. Needs ij 1.37b or higher.
- Sync_Measure_3D writes the shift values in rows for each channel at the end of the results window.
  This makes processing of shifts in a spreadsheet program easier and enables using shift values in 
  Boris Joffe's _StackGroom plugin for shift correction.
- Can use the image scaling and offset values for determining cursor positions in synchronized images. This
  only works correctly, when the images have the same length unit i.e. the difference between 10nm and 
  10um is not recognized, but the difference between 10um and 0.01um is.
- Frames and Channels of Image5Ds can be synchronized.
- Corrected a compilation problem that would make Sync_Measure_3D unresponsive at the first measurement 
  when measurements were performed in spatially calibrated images.
v.1.5 finished 2006-04-18

Version 1.6:
- Works with Image5D v1.1.6, which sorts base Image5D classes in a package structure.
- Fixed bug: Cropped images in synchronized windows are not eqally sized when the ROI is selected 
	at zoom <100%. Maybe fixed by using screenXD/YD instead of screenX/Y
- Fixed bug: For the active window of several synchronized images the position values are not updated 
	in the statusbar. You move the cursor, but always see the same position/intensity. 
v1.6 started 2006-05-21
v.1.6 finished 2006-09-29

Version 1.7:
- Works with Image5D v1.2.0 (where Scrollbars for z and t have been changed).
- Also synchronizes slices (channels, frames), when they are changed by moving the mousewheel.
