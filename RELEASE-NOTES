It is a great pleasure to announce a new Fiji version nick-named Plzen.  It was
named after the city in which we had a very successful image processing school,
where we tested a few of the shiny new components which are the goodies of this
release.  The two most prominent new features are

- the new and shiny Fiji Updater.  The updater knows whether your files are
  up-to-date, obsolete or locally modified.  It will check at startup whether
  there are updates available, and if so, offer you to run the updater.  You
  can also choose to be reminded later, or not ever again.

- the Script Editor.  Just call File>New>Script, select a language and start
  writing a script.  The editor has syntax highlighting and you can run the
  script without even saving it.

  For an introduction to the power of scripting, see e.g.

Other changes include:

- lots of bug fixes (thanks to all!)
- many, many improvements in the Register Virtual Stack Slices plugin (thanks
  to Ignacio Arganda Carreras and Albert Cardona)
- a metric ton of improvements in TrakEM2 (thanks Stephan Saalfeld and Albert)
- substantial work has been performed on the Level Sets plugin (thanks to
  Erwin Frise and Albert)
- on Windows, a possible infinite loop upon startup was fixed
- the Sync Win plugin was added
- we ship a new Clojure version now, and support for this language was
  enhanced (thanks to Albert)
- our Stack Manipulation collection now has Bob Dougherty's Stack_Sorter
  (thanks to Bob, Jean-Yves Tinevez and Christophe Leterrier), Interleave
  and Deinterleave (thanks to Tony Collins and Jean-Yves), and Grouped
  ZProjector (thanks Jean-Yves)
- we have a circle fitter which can recognize a single circle, even if there
  are fluctuations in the signal
- a lot of encodings were fixed (you should no longer get funny little squares
  in place of non-ASCII characters)
- for better integration with the Swing library, we have a JImagePanel that
  can show a single ImagePlus (thanks to the FocalPoint developers!)
- we can read/write .xpm and .lss16 files now
- you can download a LiveCD image and an image you can put on a USB stick now
- lots and lots of improvements in the AnalyzeSkeleton plugin (thanks to
  Ignacio)
- we now bundle the Gray Morphology and several Colocalisation plugins, too
- Bio-Formats was updated to include the new AmiraMesh reader (thanks to
  Gregory Jefferis)
- changes in the bUnwarpJ plugin (amongst other enhancements) allow tighter
  integration with the Register Virtual Stack plugin (thanks Ignacio)
- the Level Sets plugin is now available inside TrakEM2, too
- if you have problems with a particular file format, you can send it to us
  using Help>Upload Sample Image
- on MacOSX/PowerPC64, Fiji does not try to launch a 64-bit Java (because Apple
  does not provide any 64-bit Java for PowerPC)
- scripts are sorted alphabetically before they are added to menus (for
  consistency between different computers)
- loading compressed NRRD images via network is much faster now (thanks Greg!)
- thanks to Bob Dougherty, we bundle the Local Thickness plugin, too
- compressed BioRad images are read correctly now (thanks Greg)
- fixed rendering in the SIFT Align plugin (thanks to Stephan Saalfeld and
  Gabriel Landini)
- upgraded the 3D Object Counter plugin (thanks to Fabrice Cordelières and
  Daniel James White)
- when launched on MacOSX by double-clicking the icon (or by running from the
  Dock), the current directory is set to Fiji's application directory (thanks
  Greg and Christophe)
- upgraded the LSM Toolbox/Reader to version 0.4f (thanks Mark Longair, Greg,
  Patrick Pirotte and Jerôme Mutterer)
- on MacOSX, the Lookup Tables from the luts/ directory are finally visible.
- Help>Update Menus handles not only .jar and .class plugins, but
  plugin scripts, too
- we have File>New>Fiji Tutorial, which makes it a breeze to write tutorials
  with screen shots for the Fiji Wiki
- on MacOSX, the default Java extensions were not available by mistake
- sample images can be stored in the samples/ subdirectory, allowing for
  completely off-line File>Open Sample>?
- the Stitching plugin now has a file and directory chooser (thanks to Stephan
  Preibisch)
- .lei and .dv files are opened with Bio-Formats now

- we ship the Manual Tracking plugin now, too (thanks to Fabrice Cordelières)
- we ship the Calculator Plus plugin now, too (thanks to Daniel Hornung and
  Gabriel)

  plugin right away
- Fiji is built with Java5 every night to ensure that it continues to work on
  32-bit MacOSX prior to 10.6.
- the Macro Interpreter outputs the help correctly again (thanks Gabriel)
- added two lookup tables, "thermal" and "glasbey" (thanks to Michael Doube
  and Gabriel)
- the Help>Report a Bug plugin is much more user-friendly now (thanks Mark)
- updated View5D, fixed interaction with Bio-Formats (thanks to Simon Kidd)
- when JAVA_HOME is set to a bogus location Fiji ignores it now (thanks Albert)
- avoid mistaking .jar files inside .rsrc/ directories for real .jar files,
  working around a MacOSX quirk (thanks to Maté Biro)
- ImageJ was updated to version 1.43h
- the Command Launcher (Ctrl-L in the Fiji window) was converted to Swing,
  and sports a fuzzy matching, and an option to show more information such
  as which .jar file that plugin is contained in, for a much-improved
  user-experience (thanks Mark)
- ImageJ now opens websites in the preferred browser on Linux
- cropping an image marks it as modified now
- Plugins>Install Plugin... can install .jar files now (provided you have
  permission to write to Fiji's plugins/ directory)
- On MacOSX, the .dmg opens with a background image instructing the user
  how to install Fiji by dragging it to the Applications folder
- allow scripting of Bio-Formats again
- allow the script interpreters to run in headless mode

The list is so long because we did not get the opportunity to meet and get
a new release done in July, as we all hoped.

A big thanks goes to all the contributors and users, especially those who
helped us find and fix bugs!
