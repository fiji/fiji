fiji (0.9.1-Dresden-rc3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a package of the Dresden-rc3 release.  In this version
    I have abandoned the careful approach of the previous packages
    and this is just a monolithic package with everything you
    need for Fiji.  This is more in the spirit of the Fiji project,
    but would create a lot of problems if it were to be included
    in Debian / Ubuntu in the future.  For the moment it's more
    important that we can just get a .deb out there for the release.
