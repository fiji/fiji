Sign the packages

Should there be a dependency on python-2.5-minimal?  Yes - it's
  required to build fiji-jython, where if /usr/lib/python2.5 doesn't
  exist, it downloads an archive to include in the jar.  However,
  python2.5 has been removed from Ubuntu, so I automatic
  build-dependency resolution on Lucid won't work...

  Currently the build process is downloading the source to build -
  this probably breaks policy somehow.

jna.jar is packaged in libjna-java - should use that

The man page for fiji should be in fiji-base, not fiji.

Problematic packages for copyright in that they have many authors
include:
   - fiji-examples
   - fiji-plugins

fiji-plugins is still plugin soup - more packages need to be separated
   out from there over time

Allow a per-user plugins directory as well as the system-wide one.

bio-formats includes lots of jars in the source archive - there's a
   dependency tangle to be sorted out there

debian/update-debian.py has a lot of hard-coded data, which should be
   tidied up and extracted out.  (Some doesn't need to be hard-coded
   at all.)  In general, that's now very hacky - especially the
   cleaning steps and rewriting of the Fakefile.)

The exactly required submodules are currently documented in
   debian/weekly-build.sh - this should be in a separate configuration
   file.

bio-formats, AutoComplete and RSyntaxTextArea can usefully be non-Fiji jars,
   i.e. just a jar in /usr/share/java/
