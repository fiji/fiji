 plugins/bUnwarpJ_.jar: bUnwarpJ allows simultaneous and consistent
 registration of two images based on elastic deformations represented by
 B-splines. Registration is the transformation of one image into another.
 Here, one of the image would be elastically deformed in order to look as
 similar as possible to the other image. The plugin calculates an
 "inverse" transformation so that a pseudo-invertibility of the deformed
 image can be done. Thus two images are given as a result - The deformed
 versions of the two given images.

Description: components from Fiji, including: PIV analyser, ij-app, PointPick [...]
 The descriptions below are extracted from the Fiji Updater database:
 .
 plugins/PIV_analyser.jar: Calculates the optic flow for each pair of
 images made with the given stack. It uses the PIV method, which is the
 most basic technique for optic flow. This technique, mainly used in
 acoustics or in fluids mechanics, enables the measurements of a velocity
 field in one plane, using imaging and image analysis.
 .
 plugins/PointPicker_.jar: This plugin allows you to pick some points in
 an image or a stack and to save the list of pixel coordinates as a text
 file, which may be useful to further process the list within another
 application (e.g., for the computation of a path length). Alternatively,
 it is possible to read back the text file so as to restore the display
 of the coordinates, perhaps over another image if desired (e.g., to
 compare positions).
 .
 scripts/Matlab3DViewerDemo_1.m: A MATLAB script that demonstrates how to
 use Fiji from MATLAB to have a nice 3D viewer for the later.
 .
 plugins/Scripts/Plugins/Registration/Correct_3D_drift.py: Correct for 3D
 drift of long recordings.
 .
 jars/imageware.jar: A core library for many of the plugins of the
 Biomedical Imaging Group of the EPFL.
 .
 plugins/Directionality_.jar: This plugin is used to infer the preferred
 orientation of structures present in the input image. It computes a
 histogram indicating the amount of structures in a given direction.
 Images with completely isotropic content are expected to give a flat
 histogram, whereas images in which there is a preferred orientation are
 expected to give a histogram with a peak at that orientation.
 .
 plugins/Auto_Threshold.jar: This plugin uses Thresholding, a simple
 method of image segmentation. Given a grayscale image, the plugin
 creates a binary image (Black and White) out of it. The plugin allows
 you to do either Global Threshold or Local Threshold. Here, global means
 histogram-derived. For local thresholding, the threshold is computed for
 each pixel according to the image characteristics within a window of a
 specified radius around it.
 .
 plugins/Helmholtz_Analysis.jar: Estimate local direction and frequency
 of a sinusoidal wave
 .
 plugins/TopoJ_.jar: Evaluate the topography of surfaces of objects given
 in image stacks.
 .
 plugins/Siox_Segmentation.jar: SIOX stands for Simple Interactive Object
 Extraction and is a solution for extracting foreground from still images
 with very little user interaction. SIOX is fast, noise robust, and can
 therefore also be used for the segmentation of videos. It avoids many of
 the drawbacks of graph-based segmentation methods but performs about
 equally well on different benchmarks.
 .
 jars/javassist.jar: A powerful Bytecode manipulation library
 .
 plugins/Scripts/File/Open_Samples/Spirals_.ijm: A demonstration why
 colocalization analysis requires statistics: the "green" and "yellow"
 spirals are actually the same color.
 .
 plugins/Snakuscule_.jar: Are you afraid of snakes? or, as Emily
 Dickinson put it:      But never met this fellow,     Attended or alone,
 Without a tighter breathing,     And zero at the bone.  This ImageJ
 plugin detects circular bright blobs in images and quantifies them. It
 allows one to keep record of their location and size.
 .
 jars/ij-launcher.jar: Support classes for the ImageJ launcher
 .
 plugins/Gray_Morphology.jar: Performs the basic morphologic operations
 on a selected grayscale image: erosion, dilation, opening and closing
 with several types of structuring elements (circles, diamonds,
 horizontal lines, vertical lines, and more).
 .
 plugins/FeatureJ_.jar: Extract differential features from images
 .
 jars/mij.jar: MIJ - Access ImageJ from within Matlab
 .
 plugins/Scripts/Image/Hyperstacks/Temporal-Color_Code.ijm: Color-code
 time series into a 2D image.
 .
 plugins/UnwarpJ_.jar: An ImageJ plugin that performs a spline-based
 elastic registration of two images.
 .
 plugins/Extended_Depth_Field.jar: This plugin provides an extended depth
 of field algorithm to obtain in focus microscopic images of 3D objects
 and organisms using different algorithms :  Sobel, variance, real and
 complex wavelets.
 .
 plugins/ToAST_.jar: Tool for Automated Sporozoite Tracking (ToAST)
 allows the rapid simultaneous analysis of several hundred motile
 Plasmodium sporozoites, the stage of the malaria parasite transmitted by
 the mosquito. ToAST reliably categorizes different modes of sporozoite
 movement and can be used for both tracking changes in movement patterns
 and comparing overall movement parameters, such as average speed or the
 persistence of sporozoites undergoing a certain type of movement.
 .
 plugins/Trainable_Segmentation.jar: This plugin trains a classifier on
 manual annotations. Afterwards the classifier can be applied to other
 images or stacks.
 .
 plugins/Video_Editing.jar: Accessible through Image>Video Editing. ¶
 Used for special video editing tasks, which makes use of a writable
 virtual stack that forms the core of this plugin. The writable virtual
 stack stores the individual frames in an own folder. Another file in the
 same directory, called 'indices', stores the order of the frames in a
 list of numbers. When a new frame is added, the highest appearing number
 is increased by one and used for the file name. The plugin also allows
 for animated drawing via "Draw Roi" and "Move Roi", where the user has
 to provide a ROI.
 .
 scripts/Matlab3DViewerIntroduction.m: A MATLAB script that introduces
 some demonstration scripts.
 .
 jars/fiji-compat.jar: Support classes for Fiji to run with ImageJ1
 .
 plugins/Anisotropic_Diffusion_2D.jar: Tschumperle-Deriche Anisotropic
 Diffusion, based on CImg's implementation.
 .
 plugins/Image_Expression_Parser.jar: This plugin parses arbitrary
 mathematical expressions and compute results using images as variables.
 .
 plugins/StackReg_.jar: Register a stack of image slices. In turn, each
 slice is used as the template with respect to which the next slice is
 aligned, so that the alignment proceeds by propagation. When the plugin
 is launched, the current slice acts as a global anchor.
 .
 plugins/Series_Labeler.jar: This plugin allows the user to put a
 customizable time code into time series.
 .
 plugins/SheppLogan_.jar: The purpose of this plugin is to generate
 sampled versions of the Shepp-Logan phantom. It is possible to specify
 the location of the origin (so that the figure may be made symmetric
 with respect to the center of a pixel or with respect to the boundary
 between pixels). Unfortunately, what is apparently a typo has crept into
 the original paper. There, Table I pp. 32 mentions that Ellipse g should
 have intensity 0.01, while Figure 1 pp. 34 clearly suggests that the
 intensity of Ellipse g should be instead 0.02, which is apparent both
 from the caption of Figure 1 and from the figure itself. The SheppLogan
 plugin can be configured to generate both versions.
 .
 plugins/register_virtual_stack_slices.jar: Takes a sequence of image
 slices stored in a folder, and delivers a list of registered image
 slices (with enlarged canvas). One of the images in the sequence can be
 selected by the user as reference and it will remain intact. ¶ The
 plugin can perform 6 types of image registration techniques: ¶ -
 Translation ¶ - Rigid (translation + rotation) ¶ - Similarity
 (translation + rotation + isotropic scaling) ¶ - Affine ¶ - Elastic (via
 bUnwarpJ with cubic B-splines) ¶ - Moving least squares
 .
 plugins/RandomJ_.jar: Add all kind of parameterized noise to images
 .
 scripts/InstallJava3D.m: A verbose MATLAB script to automate
 installation of Java3D.
 .
 plugins/Feature_Detection.jar: A plugin for detecting vessel or tubelike
 structures in images.
 .
 plugins/IJ_Robot.jar: The purpose of the plugin is to allow the macro
 language to control other programs via clicking and key presses in which
 these "orders" are specified by the user to this plugin. Orders include
 "Move", "Clicks", "CaptureScreen" and others, and for some orders
 parameters like position (x, y) are required.
 .
 plugins/MosaicJ_.jar: The purpose of this plugin is to facilitate the
 assembly of a mosaic of overlapping individual images, or tiles. It
 provides a semi-automated solution where the initial rough positioning
 of the tiles must be performed by the user, and where the final delicate
 adjustments are performed by the plugin.
 .
 plugins/Samples_.jar: A package adding links to File>Open Samples.
 .
 plugins/Analyze_Reader_Writer.jar: Enables reading and saving of .img
 file format. Does this through menus File>Import>Analyze... and
 File>Save As>Analyze... respectively.
 .
 plugins/registration_3d.jar: Uses the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm
 to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components. The input
 image is the spatial domain while the output of the transformation
 represents the image in the frequency domain.
 .
 plugins/RATS_.jar: Robust Automatic Threshold Selection (RATS)  This
 algorithm determines local thresholds based on the pixel values and
 their gradient.
 .
 scripts/IsJava3DInstalled.m: A MATLAB function to test whether Java3D is
 installed or not, and eventually install it.
 .
 plugins/Colour_Deconvolution.jar: This plugin implements stain
 separation using the colour deconvolution.
 .
 plugins/Fiji_Package_Maker.jar: Make your own Fiji package within
 seconds! The resulting .zip or .tar.gz file will include all the plugins
 currently installed.
 .
 plugins/Statistical_Region_Merging.jar: Performs segmentation on an
 8-bit grayscale image of a user's choice by using the statistical region
 merging segmentation algorithm. The user may specify a parameter Q that
 determines how precise the segmentation would be.
 .
 plugins/Record_Screen.jar: Relies on python scripts to provide an
 utility where upon given the user-desired settings, would allow the user
 to record activity through screenshots of either the desktop or of a
 user-selected window of an application that is opened by Fiji.
 .
 plugins/Stack_Manipulation.jar: This is a collection of various "small
 plugins", like an utility package, dedicated to the manipulation of
 stacks, namely combining, concatenating, interleaving, sorting and so
 on. You can find them in the Image > Stack > Tools_ menu, next to the
 ones provided by bare ImageJ.
 .
 plugins/Differentials_.jar: This plugin allows you to perform several
 differentiation operations on images, seen as continuous functions, even
 though they are stored as discrete pixels.
 .
 scripts/Miji.m: Use this Matlab function to initialize MIJ
 .
 plugins/Skeletonize3D_.jar: Used for shape analysis. Given an 8-bit
 grayscale image or stack, the Skeletonize3D plugin will generate a thin
 version of the present shape (Skeleton image), making it equidistant to
 its boundaries. Some may regard this method as binary thinning. The
 shape is eroded iteratively until only the skeleton remains - It is
 performed symmetrically in order to guarantee the medial position of the
 skeleton lines and to preserve the connectedness of the object.
 .
 plugins/Scripts/Image/Adjust/Scale_to_DPI.js: A Javascript to scale an
 image to a given dots per inch.
 .
 scripts/bfopen.m: A Matlab script which interfaces with Bio-Formats
 .
 plugins/Colocalisation_Analysis.jar: This plugin (AKA Coloc 2) is
 supposed to be the One Colocalisation Plugin to Rule Them All. It
 implements Pearson's, Manders', Li's and Costes' methods for
 colocalisation analysis by pixel intensity correlation over space (ie.
 not object based coloc).  For backwards compatibility, Tony Collins' two
 plugins are included as well: Colocalization Test performs one of a set
 of three statistical tests, comparing the Pearson's correlation
 coefficient of 2 colour channels in the real image data against the same
 image data with one of the colour channels scrambled or spatially
 shifted, repeated a number of times. Colocalization Threshold sets the
 thresholds for colocalization analysis, and also calculates Manders'
 coefficients, 2D histogram / scatter plot, and other stats.
 .
 plugins/Scripts/Image/Color/Set_Color_By_Wavelength.ijm: A toy "set
 color by wavelength" macro. Not very precise (yet).
 .
 jars/wavelets.jar: A core library for many of the plugins of the
 Biomedical Imaging Group of the EPFL.
 .
 plugins/Stitching_.jar: Taking an image of a biological specimen at a
 high resolution may not fit in the field view of a microscope. Thus
 there are motorized stages which would help create a tiled scan of the
 specimen. ¶ Stitching_.jar allows one to reconstruct big images/stacks
 from a number of tiled input images/stacks, making use of the Fourier
 Shift Theorem that computes all possible translations (x, y[, z])
 between two 2D/3D images at once, yielding the best overlap in terms of
 the cross correlation measure. ¶ If more than two input images/stacks
 are used the correct placement of all tiles is determined using a global
 optimization. To remove brightness differences at the tile borders, non-
 linear intensity blending is applied.
 .
 plugins/Arrow_.jar: This version replaces the old Arrow_.class tool that
 was present in Fiji before. The main changes are the ability to draw the
 arrow as a floating selection, and to tune its shape.
 .
 plugins/IsoData_Classifier.jar: An extension of the classical IsoData
 thresholding to multiple classes.
 .
 plugins/SplineDeformationGenerator_.jar: Allows different types of
 deformations over any given image. The images are represented by cubic
 B-splines, which allows the correct interpolation of non-integer
 positions and ensures the images' continuity. It can perform 5 different
 types of image deformations: Elastic, Fisheye, Perspective,
 Barrel/Pincushion, and 2D gels.
 .
 plugins/Graph_Cut.jar: The Graph Cut plugin provides a way to obtain a
 globally smooth binary segmentation. As input, you have to provide a
 gray-scale image that represents the pixel affinities for belonging to
 the foreground. Via a single parameter you can adjust the smoothness of
 the segmentation.
 .
 plugins/QuickPALM_.jar: The software side of the QuickPALM project, to
 obtain super-resolution images.
 .
 plugins/SPIM_Registration.jar: Bead-based registration of multi-angle
 recordings, offers reconstruction of a single image with close to
 isotropic resolution.
 .
 macros/StartupMacros.fiji.ijm: Fiji's template (and default)
 StartupMacros.  When a user wants to edit them, the file is copied to
 macros/StartupMacros.ijm and overrides the default.
 .
 plugins/level_sets.jar: Level Sets segmentation techniques are based on
 partial differential equations (PDE), i.e. progressive evaluation of the
 differences among neighboring pixels to find object boundaries. Ideally,
 the algorithm will converge at the boundary of the object where the
 differences are the highest. ¶ The Fiji plugin provides two PDE based
 methods, the more basic fast marching and the advanced active contour
 algorithm. Level sets advance a contour like a rubber band until the
 contour hits an object boundary. The rubber band like nature (=
 curvature) prevents the contour from leaking if there are gaps in the
 boundary. The strength of the rubber band and a gray level difference
 can be pre-selected.
 .
 plugins/Scripts/File/Open_Samples/Adelsons_Squares.ijm: An example macro
 demonstrating that human vision is not optimized to measure absolute
 gray values.
 .
 plugins/AnalyzeSkeleton_.jar: Given an 8-bit grayscale image or stack,
 this plugin will analyze how the skeleton image is like. It would tag
 all pixels/voxels, counting all its junctions, triple points and
 branches and measures their average and maximum length. These
 information would be shown in a new window. A visualization of the
 analysis would also be displayed, with voxels having different colours
 according to their tag.
 .
 jars/weave_jy2java.jar: The library class fiji.scripting.Weaver to
 inline java code in a script.
 .
 plugins/Time_Stamper.jar: Adds time stamps to a stack. The times are
 drawn in the current foreground color. A dialog box allows the user to
 specify the starting time, time between frames, location, font size,
 decimal places and unit of time.
 .
 plugins/FlowJ_.jar: FlowJ is a collection of 2D optical flow algorithms.
 The plugin implements the main gradient-based optical flow techniques,
 such as Lucas and Kanade, Uras, Fleet and Jepson and Singh algorithms.
 It can measure and visualize the image flow (related to motion) in any
 open stack.
 .
 plugins/Threshold_Colour.jar: This plugin isolates pixels in an RGB
 image or stack according to a range of Hue.  Original PassBand2 by Bob
 Dougherty. Some code borrowed from ThresholdAdjuster by Wayne Rasband.
 .
 scripts/Matlab3DViewerDemo_2.m: A MATLAB script that demonstrates how to
 use Fiji from MATLAB to have a nice 3D viewer for the later. This demo
 focuses on iso-surfaces.
 .
 plugins/Dichromacy_.jar: Simulation of dichromatic vision (colour
 blindness)
 .
 plugins/Fiji_Plugins.jar: A collection of single-shot plugins for Fiji.
 On Edit>Selection, "Fit Circle to Image" will fit a circle selection to
 an image. On "Dynamic Reslice" of Image>Stacks is a dynamic version of
 the Reslice command. It draws an orthogonal slice through the volume
 represented by the stack it is applied on along its ROI, and update
 dynamically this slice as the ROI is displaced or deformed. One may also
 upload a sample image to Fiji server through Help>Upload Sample Image.
 .
 plugins/Linear_Kuwahara.jar: This plugin extends the idea of the
 original Kuwahara filter from rectangular kernels to (straight) linear
 ones.
