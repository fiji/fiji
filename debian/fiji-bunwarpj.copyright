bUnwarpJ has been developed during several years already and many
people need to be acknowledged for:

It started as an extension of UnwarpJ from Carlos O. S. Sorzano and
thanks to him and Jan Kybic at the Center for Machine Perception in
Prague, bUnwarpJ was born in the summer 2005 and published online in
2006.

Many of the plugin updates and improvements would have never been
possible without the hackathons that took place in Janelia Farm
Research Campus (Virginia, summer 2008) and the Institute of
Neuroinformatics (ZÃ¼rich, winter 2008).

Albert Cardona organized the hackathons and is responsible for the
code parallelization and javascripting support.

Stephan Saalfeld proposed and helped to make the SIFT/MOPS support
possible.

Marta Rivera-Alba helped with the macro support and code debugging.

Johannes Schindelin is responsible for the Fiji integration and he is
simply there whenever a Java problem comes up!
